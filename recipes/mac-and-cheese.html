    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1/4 cup panko break crumbs</li>
      <li>1/4 real bacon bits</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on
        a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring
        occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so
        noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the
        liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir
        in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and
        bacon bits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and
        crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
